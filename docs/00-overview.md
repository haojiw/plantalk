# Plantalk: The Voice Journal


**Plantalk** is a voice-first journal designed to make **reflection a simple, consistent habit**.

You speak, and the app instantly converts your thoughts into a clear, organized journal entry. This lets you process your thoughts out loud and stay present in your day.

## How It Works (Core V1)

The current version focuses on a fast, private, and forgiving recording-to-saving flow:

1.  **Record**: Tap to start and stop your voice entry. Includes pause/resume.
2.  **Transcribe**: Reliably converts your spoken words into text.
3.  **Refine**: Cleans up the text for readability, adding light formatting and titles.
4.  **Save**: Stores a single entry containing both the audio and the refined text.

*The entire process is designed to be **fast, forgiving, and private**.*

## The Vision: Reflection and Insight

Beyond the core recording function, Plantalk is built to help you organize your life and understand yourself better over time.

### Future Features

| Category | Goal | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Habit Building** | Encourage consistent reflection. | Gentle reminders, non-shaming streaks, and "tiny wins" that reinforce the habit. |
| **Organization** | Make past thoughts easy to find. | Tags, smart search, and simple structure for finding ideas, notes, decisions, etc. |
| **AI as a Mirror** | Surface patterns in your thinking. | Once you have enough entries, the AI will provide **Insights** on: your personality, core themes, experiences, identity and goals. |

*The AI's purpose is to **reflect** you like a mirror. Not to judge you like a coach or comfort you like a companion. It is YOU. Your strength comes from within*
