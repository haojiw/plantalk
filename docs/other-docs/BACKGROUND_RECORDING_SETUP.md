# Background Recording Setup Guide

This document outlines the configuration needed to ensure audio recording continues in the background and on lock screen.

## ‚úÖ Completed Configurations

### 1. App Configuration (`app.config.js`)

#### iOS Settings:
- **UIBackgroundModes**: `["audio"]` - Enables background audio processing
- **NSMicrophoneUsageDescription**: Explicit microphone permission description
- **AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord**: Enables recording in background
- **AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions**: Enhanced audio session options for better compatibility

#### Android Settings:
- **RECORD_AUDIO**: Basic recording permission
- **WAKE_LOCK**: Prevents device from sleeping during recording
- **FOREGROUND_SERVICE**: Allows background processing
- **FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE**: Specific microphone access in background

### 2. Audio Mode Configuration (`useRecorder.ts`)

```javascript
await setAudioModeAsync({
  allowsRecording: true,
  playsInSilentMode: true,
  shouldPlayInBackground: true,
  interruptionMode: 'doNotMix',
  interruptionModeAndroid: 'doNotMix',
});
```

### 3. App State Monitoring
- Added AppState listener to track when app goes to background
- Provides logging for debugging background recording issues

## üîß Additional Considerations

### iOS Specific:

1. **Development vs Production**:
   - Background recording works fully only in production builds
   - Test with `expo run:ios` or TestFlight, not Expo Go

2. **Audio Session Interruptions**:
   - Phone calls will interrupt recording
   - Other audio apps may interrupt if they don't respect mixing

3. **Battery Optimization**:
   - iOS may terminate background apps for battery conservation
   - Recording apps are generally protected from this

### Android Specific:

1. **Battery Optimization**:
   - Users may need to disable battery optimization for your app
   - Different manufacturers have different settings (Samsung, Xiaomi, etc.)

2. **Foreground Service**:
   - Consider implementing a foreground service with notification for longer recordings
   - This makes the recording more visible and less likely to be killed

3. **Auto-start Management**:
   - Some devices have auto-start managers that can prevent background execution

## üß™ Testing Background Recording

### Test Scenarios:
1. Start recording ‚Üí Lock device ‚Üí Wait ‚Üí Unlock ‚Üí Check if recording continued
2. Start recording ‚Üí Switch to another app ‚Üí Return ‚Üí Verify recording state
3. Start recording ‚Üí Receive phone call ‚Üí After call ends ‚Üí Check recording
4. Long recording sessions (30+ minutes) in background

### Debugging:
- Check console logs for app state changes
- Monitor recording duration to ensure it continues incrementing
- Test on actual devices, not simulators

## üì± User Instructions

### For iOS:
1. Ensure microphone permissions are granted
2. Keep app in recent apps (don't force close)
3. Recording should continue even when device is locked

### For Android:
1. Grant microphone permissions
2. If recording stops in background:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Plantalk ‚Üí Battery ‚Üí Don't optimize
   - Or Settings ‚Üí Battery ‚Üí Battery optimization ‚Üí Plantalk ‚Üí Don't optimize
3. Keep app in recent apps

## üö® Known Limitations

1. **Phone Calls**: Will always interrupt recording (system behavior)
2. **Low Memory**: System may terminate app if device is extremely low on memory
3. **Manual App Termination**: If user force-closes app, recording will stop
4. **Some Audio Apps**: May interrupt recording if they request exclusive audio access

## üîç Troubleshooting

If background recording stops:

1. **Check Permissions**: Ensure microphone permission is granted
2. **Check Battery Settings**: Disable battery optimization (Android)
3. **Check Audio Mode**: Verify `shouldPlayInBackground: true` is set
4. **Test Build Type**: Use production build, not development
5. **Check Device Settings**: Some manufacturers have additional restrictions

## üìã Recommended Next Steps

1. **Test on Physical Devices**: Essential for accurate testing
2. **Add Foreground Service (Android)**: For enhanced reliability
3. **Implement Recording Persistence**: Save recording state to handle app restarts
4. **Add User Guidance**: In-app tips about battery optimization settings
5. **Consider Notification**: Show recording status in notification area
